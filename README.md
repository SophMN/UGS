Urogenital Schistosomiasis among Women in Kilifi County, Kenya

Urogenital schistosomiasis (UGS) is a disease caused by the parasite Schistosoma haematobium. It is a disease of poverty, mainly affecting people with poor access to water and sanitation facilities. Women get infected with S. haematobium while fetching water or performing domestic chores in freshwater infested with snails that harbour parasite cercariae. If left untreated, the disease could result in pelvic inflammatory disease, increased susceptibility to STIs, cervical cancer, bladder cancer and adverse pregnancy outcomes. In Kenya, the coastal region has the highest burden of UGS. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with UGS among women of reproductive age in Kilifi County. Majority of the research on UGS in Kenya focuses on school-aged children, with less emphasis on adult populations. Therefore, this study sought to address this gap by investigating the prevalence and risk factors associated with UGS among women of reproductive age in selected areas in Kilifi County.
