**Urogenital Schistosomiasis in Kenya**

Urogenital schistosomiasis (UGS) is a disease caused by the parasite Schistosoma haematobium. It is a disease of poverty, mainly affecting people with poor access to water and sanitation facilities. Women get infected with S. haematobium while fetching water or performing domestic chores in freshwater infested with snails that harbour parasite cercariae. If left untreated, the disease could result in pelvic inflammatory disease, increased susceptibility to STIs, cervical cancer, bladder cancer and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Here, I present the analysis of the clinical and behavioural risk factors associated with UGS infection among women of reproductive age by performing association tests and binomial logistic regression.
